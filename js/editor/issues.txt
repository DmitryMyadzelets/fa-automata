Bugs
+ Nodes don't appear when a new graph attached without active forces.
- Stack of undo\redo reffers to a wrong view\objects when a new graph attached. (Make a local stack attached to the view).a


Must to do
+ Make 'initial' state command
- Make export to a usable formats.
	+ What programs can accept SVG? Latex (how?), Inscape, ...
	- Image
- Make github...io page for demonstration.
	- Describe API

May to do
- Too many savings to local storage while editing.
- Implement edge movement in the model (it's in wrapper only).
- Make on('update', function () {} ) instead of o[key] = function () {} for the events.
- Unlink the Controller from d3 (view's implementation).
- Make Commands and the Model have the same methods.
- Make a nice appearence and disappearance of nodes when they are added\removed.
- Make nodes and edges highlighted (CSS class).
- Make BFS or DFS plugin.


Architecture wrt SOLID principles
- Open Close Principle (OSP). The nodes are always circles now, but it can be changed. Calculation of edges implies that the nodes are circles. a node should provid connection points to an edge (like in Violet UML editor), given some information from the edge (e.g. an outgoing angle, a reference to another node etc.);
- Compose atomic undoable uperations into compaund operations? E.g. Create new edge into empty space = adding an edge and a node.
